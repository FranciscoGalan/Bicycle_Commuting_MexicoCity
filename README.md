# Bicycle Commuting Analysis | Mexico City

Analyzed government data from 2015 to 2020 to determine which hour, day, month, and location is the safest to travel by bicycle in Mexico City.    

NOTE: The original analysis was made in Spanish, so you might see a few words in Spanish here and there. 

## Data

The original data was taken from three datasets of Mexico City's government [website](https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/):

| Dataset                         | Location                                                     | Date of download |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Bicycle counter                 | https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/contador-ciclistas         | 11-Dec-2020      |
| Road accidents                  | https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/incidentes-viales-c5       | 11-Dec-2020      |
| Estudio de Conteo ciclista 2018 | https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/estudio-de-conteo-ciclista-2018 | 11-Dec-2020      |

However, in the **[Notebook main.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FranciscoGalan/Bicycle_Commuting_Mexico_City/blob/main/main.ipynb)**, I explored the datasets and transformed them to a version which I could then use to create visualizations. You can fin the transformed datasets here:

### Location

Accidents occur throughout Mexico City. However, many of them concentrate on the main avenues, although it is hard to tell is this is because more people pass through them. 

We also see that many accidents occur at intersections:
